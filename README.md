## Overview
This Project is submitted as part of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree.

For it the target is to analyze the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to them about new articles we believe they will like. Below you can see an example of what the dashboard could look like displaying articles on the IBM Watson Platform:

## Requirements
In order to facilitate the execution of the Notebooks and of the scripts I have prepared an [`environment.yml`](./environment.yml) file to be used to install an environment with [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads):

```sh
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

After the installation the environment should be visible via `conda info --envs`:

```sh
# conda environments:
#
dsnd-proj5        /usr/local/anaconda3/envs/dsnd-proj5
...

```

Further documentation on working with Anaconda environments can be found [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html). 

## Results
The exercise is completed as a (fairly self-explanatory) Jupyter notebook available [here](./Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb). Details on the various sections that the noebook is divided into are als provided is a separated [writeup](./Recommendation_engine_writeup.md).
